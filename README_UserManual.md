User Manual for program file TicketingSystemPrototype.py

To execute the program load the file TicketingProgramPrototype.py into the PyCharm IDE ( Integrated Development Environment ) and click on run TicketingProgramPrototype.py.

Expand the run tool window tab vertically to the top of the screen. This will give more space for the program to display its updates.

In the run tool window tab a menu will appear with two options, create a ticket or view tickets. Below these options a console will appear that displays the number of tickets submitted, the number of tickets open for response, and the number of tickets resolved. These statistics are monitored and updated automatically by the program and do not require a user input.

(If view tickets is selected and there are no tickets in the folder you will receive a message saying there are no tickets in the folder to view.)

To begin press 1 to create your first ticket then follow the prompts in the run tool window tab. Enter the fields that require a text input and select from the numerical options that are required by the program.

If a ticket has the words ‘password’ and ‘change’ in the ticket description a new password will appear as a response in the ticket response field. The ticket will also be closed as the issue has been resolved.

Once a ticket has been created the ticket will be given a ticket number starting at 2001. For each subsequent ticket the ticket number will increase by 1.

Upon creation tickets can be viewed in the ticket folder by selecting the ‘view tickets’ option in the main menu.

The program has a maximum capacity of five tickets all of which can be viewed with the option to change the priority level of the ticket, the ticket status, and the ticket response.

The ticket priority is initially set by the user when creating the ticket. Using the ‘change ticket priority’ selection options this priority can be changed to either HIGH, MEDIUM or LOW depending on the original priority setting.

The ticket status is initially set automatically to ‘Open’ when the ticket is created. Using the ‘change ticket status’ selection option this can be changed to ‘Closed’ when the ticket is resolved and if necessary the ticket can be reopened.

The ticket response is initially set automatically to “Not Yet Available’ when the ticket is created. Using the ‘change ticket response’ text input option the response can be changed as often as is needed

Whenever a ticket priority, ticket status or ticket response is changed the program will generate a ticket update displaying the new ticket with the changes made.

Once the program reaches its five ticket capacity a message will appear explaining the ticket folder is full.
