My pythonProject7 folder contains the files that I have created in the process of writing my ticketing system software program.
The main programs are the UltimateProgram.py and NewClassProgram.py
These 2 files both contain the exact same code.
A main menu with 2 options, Create Ticket and View Tickets.
A fucntion TicketStats with an information panel showing the tickets active, the tickets responded to, and tickets reopened.
A function TicketForm that allows for user input the fields used in the program.
A function TicketView that allows the inputed fields to be viewed.
A fucntion TicketUpdate that allows the updated ticket to be viewed. The program has a maximum capcity of 5 tickets as it is managable for testing.
The difference between the UltimateProgram and the NewClassProgram is that the NewClassProgram has a class called Ticket:
which I will use to replace most of my global variables
